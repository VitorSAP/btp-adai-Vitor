6. Enter a name for your project.

7. Select the dev space where you want the project to reside.
    >SAP Build Code recommends the dev space it deems most suitable, and it will automatically create a new one for you if you don't already have one. If you have other dev spaces of the same type (for example, Full-Stack), you can select between them. If you want to create a different dev space, or a dev space or another type, go to the Dev Space Manager. See [Working in the Dev Space Manager](https://help.sap.com/docs/build_code/d0d8f5bfc3d640478854e6f4e7c7584a/ad40d52d0bea4d79baaf9626509caf33.html?locale=en-US&state=DRAFT&version=SHIP).

8. Click **Create**.
    
    <!-- border -->![Create](8c.png)

    You can see the project being created in the Project table of the lobby.  
    >The creation of the project may take a few moments.

9.  After you see a message stating that the project has been created successfully, click the project to open it.

    <!-- border -->![Open Project](open-project-pilot.png)

    The project opens in SAP Business Application Studio, the SAP Build Code development environment.
